As JSON does not allow comments, and the way this works currently does not allow the file names to be anything except server IDs,
(though this could easily be changed if need be), i am forced to make this.

Server IDs:
642203556312776714 = The Church of Firnando
742876189009641562 = Lordmoose213s testing server
827570784930365480 = YRUU Discord Server server
